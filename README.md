### `index.js`

```js
import { main } from "playwright-base-library";
import processing from "./processing.js"; // Your implementation logic

await main(processing);
```

### `processing.js`

```js
import {
  askUser,
  waitEntirePageToLoad,
  takeScreenshot,
} from "playwright-base-library";
import playwright from "playwright";

/**
 * Web automation logic
 * @param {playwright.Page} page - Reference to the Playwright page
 */

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The library can be customized through the following environment variables:

| Variable                               | Default Value        | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DEMO_MODE`                            | `true`               | Toggles demo mode. In demo mode, logs/simulations are used instead of real actions.        |
| `BASE_URL`                             | **Required**         | The starting URL for your automation.                                                      |
| `SCREENSHOT_FOLDER_PATH`               | `./data/screenshots` | Directory to store screenshots.                                                            |
| `LOGS_FOLDER_PATH`                     | `./data/logs`        | Directory to store logs.                                                                   |
| `USER_AGENT`                           | Chrome default       | Custom user-agent string.                                                                  |
| `USER_DATA_DIR`                        | _(optional)_         | Path to a user profile folder (useful for session persistence like cookies, logins, etc.). |
| `DEFAULT_ADDITIONAL_WAIT_TIME_SECONDS` | `3`                  | Additional wait time (in seconds) after calling `waitEntirePageToLoad(...)`.               |
| `QUESTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`             | `30`                 | Timeout (in seconds) for user input using `askUser(...)`.                                  |

## üìé Notes

- The library **requires** Playwright for any automation logic.
- Chrome is used as the default browser.
- Log files and screenshots are stored in the `data/` folder by default. You can override paths using the corresponding environment variables.
